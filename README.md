# Process Suspender

A simple AHK script that handles suspending and resuming of processes conveniently which is otherwise done in windows by going to the Resource Manager app which is quite a headache.

## Requirements
- **AutoHotkey** - https://www.autohotkey.com

## Usage
-  To suspend the current focused process, press **Alt + S**

- The script will then try to switch to the desktop first before suspending any processes.

  - This is to prevent fullscreen applications that gets stuck on the screen.

- Right-click the **tray icon** in the taskbar to manage suspended processes.
